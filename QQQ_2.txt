Once upon a time, there was a pale gem which nobody knew the power of. One day a teacher appeared in the village and told the people, "I know the power of the pale gem! I will teach you how to use it." Everyone was excited and gathered around the teacher. 

The teacher said, "Now, I will teach you how to make the pale gem magical. First you must find a special vessel and fill it with water. Then place the pale gem in the vessel and watch as it glows." Everyone was amazed! 

The teacher continued, "While holding the vessel with the pale gem in it, you must say a very special spell. Say the words 'Pale Gem, I call on you to bring us luck and fortune!' and the gem will become magical and bring us luck and fortune." 

Everyone was thrilled and thanked the teacher. The village was now filled with more luck and fortune than ever before, all thanks to the teacher who taught them all how to use the pale gem.
