Once upon a time, there was a little white cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to play with her best friend, a small boy named Timmy. They played outside in the sun every day. Fluffy liked to chase Timmy, and Timmy liked to run.

One day, Timmy learned a new word at school. He wanted to teach Fluffy the word too. Timmy said, "Fluffy, the word is 'repeat'. Can you say 'repeat'?" Fluffy looked at Timmy and said, "Meow." Timmy laughed and said, "No, Fluffy, say 'repeat'."

Fluffy tried again and said, "Meow-peat." Timmy clapped his hands and said, "Good job, Fluffy! You said the word!" Fluffy was very happy. She liked learning new words with Timmy. From that day on, Fluffy and Timmy played a game where they would teach each other new words. They had lots of fun together, and they lived happily ever after.
